Austo Motor Company is a prominent automobile manufacturer known for its range of SUV, Sedan, and Hatchback models. During a recent board meeting, the leadership team expressed concerns regarding the efficiency and targeting of their current marketing campaigns.

To address this, the company engaged its Data Analytics team to uncover deeper insights into customer preferences, income patterns, and vehicle purchasing behavior. As part of this initiative, I led a comprehensive data analysis project aimed at answering key business questions and providing actionable recommendations to improve marketing performance, boost customer satisfaction, and align product positioning with buyer expectations.
